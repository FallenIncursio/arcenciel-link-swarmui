# ArcEnCiel Link for SwarmUI

ArcEnCiel Link connects [arcenciel.io](https://arcenciel.io) to SwarmUI: download models, review image settings in your generator, and prepare the resources they require.

## Confirmed drafts and resource choices (2.5.3)

Drafts wait until you confirm Apply. Review image fields and choose whether to use the image checkpoint,
LoRAs and VAE/modules; **Keep my resources** preserves your existing selections. History combines server
entries and local backups, with Undo and export/removal on the same row. Update the Arc server together
with the extension to use the resource-selection contract. Downloads remain compatible.

## Reliable native inbox (2.5.3)

The native Link inbox separates Waiting from History. Local backups appear on their history entry;
connection checks explain recovery steps without resending a draft. Every editor requires explicit
confirmation before applying. Native values are read back before the receipt is confirmed.
Use **Check connection** after a temporary failure and reload the page after restarting the host.
Update the extension, restart its host, and reload existing browser tabs. Downloads remain compatible.

## Send image settings and prepare resources (2.5.3)

Use **Send to Link** on an Arc image or in its metadata to check the original settings against this
host. Unambiguous Steps, CFG, seed, size and sampling settings remain transferable when the image also
uses ADetailer or Hires; additional stages have their own compatibility warnings. Verified Arc resources
use the native catalog name, including renamed LoRAs and their recorded strengths. Missing or ambiguous
resources remain visible before sending.

Open the native Link inbox to review and apply settings. Standard model and LoRA selections are included
when the current graph/backend supports them. Advanced model architectures or shared graph branches
need an explicit mapping. Auto Queue / continuous generation must be disabled before applying.

Sending settings never starts generation. Device draft permission is controlled in the Arc Link Hub;
ordinary downloads continue to use the existing device key and model folders. Restart the host after
upgrading the extension. A changed runtime or source requires a fresh check rather than replaying an old draft.

## Version 2.3

- Link Keys (`lk_...`) are the only supported Link credential.
- Private downloads use a short-lived header grant bound to the configured ArcEnCiel HTTPS origin; redirects are refused.
- Worker enablement persists across SwarmUI restarts.
- Checkpoint, LoRA, VAE, embedding, GGUF, and `.sft` files participate in hourly full inventory scans.
- Local routes support browser Private Network Access and retain SwarmUI permission checks for the settings UI.

## Installation

Clone the repository into:

```text
SwarmUI/src/Extensions/ArcEnCielLink
```

Restart SwarmUI. The included `ArcEnCielLinkExtension.csproj` lets SwarmUI compile the extension against its own reference assembly. Keep `ArcEnCielLinkExtension.cs` at the extension root.

## Connect

1. Start SwarmUI with the extension installed.
2. Open the ArcEnCiel Link panel on [arcenciel.io](https://arcenciel.io).
3. Generate or select a Link Key and press **Connect**.
4. Assign the detected SwarmUI endpoint or use **Custom...** for a non-standard loopback port.

The advanced fallback is the `ArcEnCiel Link` server-settings card in SwarmUI.

## Hosted configuration (2.1.0)

All three Link workers use the same runtime variables. Set them **before starting the host**:

| Variable                 | Meaning                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCENCIEL_LINK_URL`     | HTTPS API base; normally `https://link.arcenciel.io/api/link`.             |
| `ARCENCIEL_LINK_KEY`     | Dedicated Link Key from Colab Secrets or your runtime secret store.        |
| `ARCENCIEL_LINK_ENABLED` | Startup preference: `1/true/yes/on` or `0/false/no/off`, case-insensitive. |

Explicit environment variables override saved desktop settings, including explicitly empty values. An empty key never falls back to a saved key. Missing/invalid credentials or an invalid enabled value prevent automatic downloads and produce a value-free diagnostic. Environment values are not written to the extension config or OS keyring when you pause or resume; previous desktop settings remain available after removing the overrides.

Pause/resume works during the current process. On restart, `ARCENCIEL_LINK_ENABLED` takes effect again. Changing an environment-managed key through the browser is rejected: update the runtime secret and restart the host. Existing desktop installations with valid settings need no migration. Protocol 2 and the browser toggle payload are unchanged.

For an existing notebook host, use the [versioned Link setup notebook](https://github.com/FallenIncursio/arcenciel-link-webui/blob/v2.5.3/notebooks/ArcEnCiel_Link_Setup.ipynb). It supports WebUI/Forge, ComfyUI, and SwarmUI, validates the host checkout, installs the tagged extension, and loads Colab Secrets. It does not install a model or the host itself. Select **Remote / Colab** on the website and keep the bridge private. A health-probe log alone is not proof of an authenticated worker or a completed download.

## Configuration and security

Configuration is stored in `Data/Extensions/ArcEnCielLink/config.json`:

```json
{
  "BaseUrl": "https://link.arcenciel.io/api/link",
  "LinkKey": "",
  "Enabled": false,
  "MinFreeMb": 2048,
  "MaxRetries": 5,
  "BackoffBase": 2,
  "SaveHtmlPreview": false,
  "AllowPrivateOrigins": false
}
```

The file is written with user-only permissions where supported. Production URLs must use HTTPS and may not contain credentials, a query, or a fragment. `ARCENCIEL_DEV=1` permits local HTTP during development. Retired unknown fields are discarded the next time settings are saved.

## Local routes

- `GET /arcenciel-link/ping`
- `GET/POST /arcenciel-link/settings` (authenticated SwarmUI administrators)
- `POST /arcenciel-link/toggle_link`
- `GET /arcenciel-link/folders/{kind}`
- `POST /arcenciel-link/generate_sidecars`

## Development and release

CI checks out current SwarmUI, builds its reference assembly, and compiles the extension against .NET 8. A `vX.Y.Z` tag must match `src/ArcEnCielLinkProtocol.cs` and creates a GitHub Release asset.

The extension namespace intentionally does not begin with `SwarmUI`, because SwarmUI uses that prefix for built-in extensions.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom                      | Check                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Worker offline               | Confirm a valid Link Key and enabled worker in the server-settings card.                       |
| Browser blocks local request | Accept the Private Network Access prompt; private development origins require explicit opt-in. |
| Download stays at 0%         | Check free disk space and Swarm model-directory permissions.                                   |
| SHA-256 mismatch             | Retry and check network or mirror stability.                                                   |

## Reliable download attempts (2.2.0)

The worker negotiates `job_lease_v1` with ArcEnCiel. Each device accepts one reserved download at a time and
acknowledges the attempt before opening a file. A fresh runtime identity, periodic heartbeats and attempt IDs
prevent stale workers from changing completed or cancelled jobs. The server retries expired attempts at most
three times, then reports an actionable error. Restarting a lost transfer currently downloads the file again.

Cancel interrupts the stream, hash check and retry wait, cleans this attempt's partial file and confirms cleanup.
If cancellation arrives after the atomic file commit, the installed model stays on disk. Legacy server compatibility
is retained; automatic recovery requires the updated ArcEnCiel server. Keep each device on its own Link Key.

## Guided setup (2.4.0)

Open [Link Hub](https://arcenciel.io/link) to choose your host and location, create or import a device key, and verify the setup. Local discovery runs only when requested; another computer or Google Colab connects directly without a local browser scan. Existing keys and downloads remain compatible.

Workers advertise `setup_check_v1`. A setup check transfers a fixed 4 KiB file into the selected native model folder, flushes and reads it back, verifies SHA-256, and deletes the temporary file. The result is bound to one key and runtime; shared keys, paused or busy workers cannot complete the check. Stable errors explain storage, write, transfer and cleanup failures. The check does not install a model or alter download history. The `Finish setup` button appears only after verification.

The worker also reconnects after an abrupt WebSocket transport loss or broker restart; the connection supervisor remains alive and re-announces the current runtime.

## Device tools (2.4.0)

Select this device in [Link Hub](https://arcenciel.io/link) and open **Device tools** to scan its library, inspect its download
subfolders or repair missing sidecars. The same actions work on another computer and in Google Colab through the outbound
Link connection. Use a separate Link key with inventory permission for each host/runtime.

Scans publish empty inventories as well as changes. Repair fills missing metadata and previews for models visible to your
account, preserves existing sidecars and never changes model bytes. A sidecar failure after download leaves the model completed
and shows a warning; correct permissions and retry repair. Tools show progress and support cancellation. Reconnect and start a
new scan after a timeout; interrupted work is not replayed automatically. Upgrade and restart the host to advertise `device_tools_v1`.
A small native Link panel shows the extension version and latest operation. Folder choices use the native download destination;
inventories also include other configured model roots.

## Release verification (2.4.2)

The broker reports its source revision and active deployment color. A broker retirement reconnects the worker without changing its runtime ID or cancelling an acknowledged download. Existing 2.4.0 workers remain compatible. The Link operations runbook records tested host/browser versions and transfer evidence; a healthy socket alone is not a completed-download check.
